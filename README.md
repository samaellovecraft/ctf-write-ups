# ctf-write-ups

This repository contains a collection of write-ups and solutions for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I have participated in. Where possible, I have included the source code or relevant files used in the challenge. This deliberate inclusion empowers you to delve deeper into each challenge, providing an opportunity to fathom its intricacies and understand the creative process behind its design.

> _Some write-ups are also available on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@samaellovecraft)._

> [!NOTE]
> The original ZIP archives containing the source code for the challenges are also included (where possible) and can be found in the respective challenge directories.

## What are CTFs?

CTFs, or Capture The Flag competitions, are cybersecurity events where participants solve a variety of challenges to uncover hidden flags. These challenges can cover various domains, including web security, reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, and more. Participating in CTFs is an excellent way to sharpen your hacking skills, learn new techniques, and collaborate with the cybersecurity community.

## Purpose of this Repository

Each write-up in this repository documents my thought process, techniques, and solutions used to solve the challenges. The purpose of sharing these write-ups is to not only showcase my skills but also to help others learn and improve theirs. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started in cybersecurity or an experienced hacker seeking to explore new challenges, I hope you find value in these write-ups.

## How to Use this Repository

Feel free to explore the challenges and their corresponding write-ups. The write-ups are organized into directories based on challenge categories or CTF events. Simply navigate to the specific challenge or CTF event you're interested in and read the write-up.
