Bug Report: High Severity

Summary:
Upon attempting to process a large file upload (over 1GB), the system consistently crashes and returns a server error (HTTP 500). This issue is critical as it impacts our ability to handle crucial client data efficiently.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to the Comprezzor dashboard.
2. Navigate to the file upload section.
3. Select a file larger than 1GB for upload.
4. Initiate the upload process.

Expected Behavior:
The file upload should begin processing and complete successfully without causing system instability or errors.

Observed Behavior:
- The upload process starts but halts midway.
- Server returns HTTP 500 error after a few minutes.
- Dashboard becomes unresponsive, requiring a page refresh.

Impact:
This issue severely affects our workflow and disrupts critical operations. Uploading large files is a core function of our service, and this instability undermines our ability to serve clients effectively.

Additional Information:
- This issue persists across different browsers and devices.
- Server logs indicate memory exhaustion during the upload process.

Urgency:
Given the impact on operations, we request immediate attention from administrators to investigate and resolve this critical issue.
